The Destor paper
----------------------
**[FAST'15] Design Tradeoffs for Data Deduplication Performance in Backup Workloads.**

This paper presents the parameter space in data deduplication that guides the design of Destor.
It then gives the overall architecture and the backup/restore pipeline in Destor.
Finally, we did an entensive experimentation via Destor to find reasonable solutions.
You can find the paper in doc directory.

Environment
-----------
Linux 64bit.

Dependencies
------------
1. libssl-dev is required to calculate sha-1 digest;
2. GLib 2.32 or later version 

   > libglib.so and glib.h may not be found when you first install it.

   > The header files (that originally locate in /usr/local/include/glib-2.0 and /usr/local/lib/glib-2.0/include) are required to be moved to a searchable path, such as "/usr/local/include". 

   > Also a link named libglib.so should be created in "/usr/local/lib".

3. Makefile is automatically generated by GNU autoconf and automake.

INSTALL
-------
If all dependencies are installed,
compiling destor is straightforward:

>./configure
>
>make
>
>make install

To uninstall destor, run

>make uninstall

Running
-------
If compile and install are successful, the executable file, destor, should have been moved to /usr/local/bin by default.
You can create a config file, destor.config, in where you run destor.
A sample destor.config is in the project directory.

NOTE: run **rebuild** script before destor to prepare working directory and clear data.

destor can run as follows:

1. start a backup task,
   > destor /path/to/data -p"a line as in config file"

2. start a restore task,
   > destor -r<jobid> /path/to/restore -p"a line as in config file"

3. show the current statistics of system,
   > destor -s

4. show help
   > destor -h

5. make a trace
   > destor -t /path/to/data

Configuration
-------------
A sample configuration is shown in destor.conf

To find what the parameters in destor.conf exactly mean and how to configure an existing solution (such as DDFS), please read the paper **Design Tradeoffs for Data Deduplication Performance in Backup Workloads** in doc/.
The parameter space is based on the taxonomy proposed in the paper.
(Note: The paper is somewhat difficult to follow. I am sorry about that, still working on improving the readability.)

Bugs
----
1. If the running destor is crashed artificially or unexpectedly, data consistency is not guaranted and you'd better run rebuild script.

2. Do NOT support concurrent backup/restore.

3. If working path in destor.config is modified, the rebuild script must be modified too.

4. CMA assumes the backups are deleted in FIFO order.
    > If you set a backup-retention-time, the expired backup is deleted automatically.
